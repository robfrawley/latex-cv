# [src-run] latex-cv

## Overview

[Welcome](https://src.run/go/readme_welcome)!
The `src-run/latex-cv` package provides the source code for a simple, good-looking,
and configurable CV and Cover Letter implementation in LaTeX.

### JTT

This package represents a single project within a
[large collection](https://src.run/go/explore) of open-source code released
under the *SR* namespace, comprised of framework-agnostic libraries,
and a number of Symfony bundles. These projects are authored and maintained
by [Rob Frawley 2nd](https://src.run/rmf) and
[collaborators](https://src.run/latex-cv/myInfoGithub_collaborators).
